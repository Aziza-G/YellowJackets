    <h2>ABOUT</h2> <!--This is the general overview of the show, summary of the plot-->
     <p><italic id="title">Yellowjackets</italic> is an American coming-of-age survival drama series created and executive produced by Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson.<br>
        Equal parts survival epic, psychological horror story and coming-of-age drama,<br> Yellowjackets is the saga of a team of wildly talented high school girls soccer players who become the (un)lucky survivors of a plane crash deep in the remote northern wilderness.<br>
         The series chronicles their descent from a complicated but thriving team to savage clans, while also tracking the lives they’ve attempted to piece back together nearly 25 years later, proving that the past is never really past and what began out in the wilderness is far from over. </p>
